This project is a simple terminal-based BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator and personal tracker built using Python. It allows users to calculate their BMI in either metric (kg/m²) or imperial (lb/ft²) units. Based on the BMI value and age, the program provides a health suggestion—whether the person needs to gain or lose weight or is in a normal range.

Additionally, the app offers features to:

  • Save user data using the last two digits of a phone number as a key.
  • Retrieve previously saved BMI records.
  • Recalculate or exit as desired.
 
 This tool is useful for basic health tracking and helps users become more aware of their weight status with minimal input.
